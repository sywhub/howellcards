Team Matches
#There is a matching spreadsheet for this PDF.
#For 4 pairs, we form 2 teams in 3 different compositions.
#For each composition, play 2 rounds.  Each with different table seatings.
#For each round, each table play n boards then exchange the boards.
#Technically, we call it 12 rounds.  It's really 3 matches.
#Instruct the players not to reveal their journal to the opponents.
#At the end of the tournament, collect all travelers and journals.
