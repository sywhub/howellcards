Operation for Team Match
#There is a spreadsheet corresponding to this PDF for scoring.
#This is designed for 4 pairs to play aginast each other in "team match style.  Although we still score them as pairs.
#We form 2 teams first and play the 1st match, one team against the other. There must be two tables.
#Each match has 4 rounds.
#Match begins with team 1 at NS of 1st table and EW of the 2nd; team 2 the other seats.
#Each tables get a fresh set of boards.  After they are done, tables exchange boards.  Players stay at the same positions.
#After the 2nd round, team 2 members exchange seats with each other.  (Team 1 stays at the same seats.)
Each table gets a new set of baords.  Repeat as above.
#The match ends. If there are more matches, we have a new team composistion and start again.
