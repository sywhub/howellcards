# Given # of pairs in a tournament, produce the table seating
# for each round suitable for Howell movements

# Howell movement general guideline is one pair (the highest) stays
# stationary at table one.  All other pairs move to where the lower-numbered
# pair sat preivously.  (Pair #4 goes to where pair #3 used to sit, for example).
# Further, it is best if pairs sit NS or EW alternatively for each round.

# We have previously generated all possible "seatings" for 6 to 12 pairs.

# Implement as a Python iterator

# The constructor and the iterator members (__iter__ and __next__) are "for real".
# Other member functions are experimental code.
class HowellSeats:
    # Known good initial seating by # of tables
    # The tuple is seat assignments from the 2nd to the last table
    # The first table is the highest pair number and the 1st
    # This seatings allow "movements" to be consistent: a pair will always move to
    # where the previous numbered pair sat.
